# A/B Test Mini-Study  

**Goal:**  
Evaluate the impact of a new user interface (Variant B) on customer engagement metrics compared to the current version (Variant A).  

**Approach:**  
- Defined hypotheses and determined test metrics  
- Verified assumptions (normality, equal variance)  
- Chose appropriate statistical tests (t-test or Mann-Whitney U)  
- Interpreted p-values and effect size to draw business conclusions  

**Result:**  
Statistical testing revealed whether the difference between variants was significant, guiding data-driven product decisions.  

**Skills Used:** pandas, SciPy, hypothesis testing, experiment design, visualization
