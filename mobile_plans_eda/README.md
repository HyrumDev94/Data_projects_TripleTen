# Mobile Plans: Usage & Revenue Analysis  

**Goal:**  
Analyze user behavior and revenue patterns across two mobile plans to determine which generates higher engagement and profitability.  

**Data Tasks:**  
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis  
- Calculated descriptive statistics and plan-specific KPIs  
- Visualized call duration, message count, and internet usage distributions  

**Statistical Analysis:**  
- Conducted hypothesis testing to compare average revenue between plans  
- Assessed statistical significance using t-tests  

**Key Insight:**  
The analysis identified measurable differences in user spending patterns between the two plans, providing evidence for data-driven business recommendations.  

**Skills Used:** pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, statistical testing, data visualization

## Future Improvements

- Expand the dataset with additional years of data to analyze long-term customer behavior and seasonal patterns.  
- Use machine learning to predict which plan a new customer is more likely to choose, based on historical usage.  
- Develop an interactive dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit or Plotly Dash) to visualize plan performance, user demographics, and revenue trends in real time.  
- Explore segmentation by location or age group to identify targeted marketing opportunities for each plan type.
