# Model Comparison (Classification)  

**Goal:**  
Compare the performance of multiple classification models to predict user churn and identify the most effective algorithm.  

**Process:**  
- Prepared the dataset and split into train/test sets  
- Trained logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models  
- Evaluated results using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC  
- Interpreted feature importance to explain model behavior  

**Result:**  
The Random Forest model achieved the highest overall performance, offering strong predictive accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-offs.  

**Skills Used:** scikit-learn, pandas, machine learning, model evaluation, visualization
